// Anonymous Function
const sum = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
const result = sum(5, 3); // Call the anonymous function
console.log(result); // Output: 8

// Summary âœ¨
// This code demonstrates the use of an anonymous function in JavaScript. The function is defined without a name and is assigned to the variable sum. It takes two parameters, a and b, and returns their sum using the return statement.
// The anonymous function is then called with the arguments 5 and 3, and the returned value is stored in the variable result and printed to the console.
