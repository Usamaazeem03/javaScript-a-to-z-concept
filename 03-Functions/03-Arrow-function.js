// Summary âœ¨
// This code demonstrates the use of arrow functions in JavaScript. Two arrow functions, greet and
// displayAddress, are defined to print a greeting message and an address message, respectively. The functions are then called to execute their code.
// Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax compared to traditional function expressions and do not have their own '
// this' context, making them useful in certain scenarios.
// Functions help in organizing code into reusable blocks, making it easier to read and maintain.
// Functions can take parameters and return values, but in this example, they simply perform console logging.
// Note: Functions can be declared using function declarations, function expressions (using arrow functions or anonymous functions).
// Function declarations are hoisted, meaning they can be called before they are defined in the code.
// Function expressions are not hoisted and must be defined before they are called.
