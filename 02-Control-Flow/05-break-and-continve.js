// Summary âœ¨
// This code demonstrates the use of break and continue statements in JavaScript loops.
// The break statement exits the loop entirely when a certain condition is met (in this case, when i equals 5).
// The continue statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next one when a certain condition is
// met (in this case, when j equals 5).
// Use break when you want to stop the loop completely, and use continue when you want to skip specific iterations.
// Note: Both break and continue can be used in any type of loop (for, while, do...while).
// However, they are most commonly used in for loops as shown above.
